# Updating Local Packages

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRudtPGcOt4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's a good practice to periodically update the packages your application depends on. Then, if the original developers have improved their code, your code will be improved as well.  

To do this:

1.  run `npm update` in the same directory as the `package.json` file of the application that you want to update.
2. Run `npm outdated`. There should not be any results.
